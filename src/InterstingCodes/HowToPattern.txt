-How to Print Pattern in Java

Java pattern program enhances the coding skill, logic, and looping concepts. 
It is mostly asked in Java interview to check the logic and thinking of the programmer. 
We can print a Java pattern program in different designs. To learn the pattern program, 
we must have a deep knowledge of the Java loop, such as for loop do-while loop. In this section, 
we will learn how to print a pattern in Java.

We have classified the Java pattern program into three categories:

	-Start Pattern
	-Number Pattern
	-Character Pattern

Before moving to the pattern programs, let's see the approach.
Whenever you design logic for a pattern program, first draw that pattern in the blocks, 
as we have shown in the following image. The figure presents a clear look of the pattern.

Each pattern program has two or more than two loops. The number of the loop depends on the 
complexity of pattern or logic. The first for loop works for the row and the second loop works for the column. 
In the pattern programs, Java for loop is widely used.

  1  2  3  4			Column (j)
1 *  #  #  #			
2 *  *  #  #			Rows (i)
3 *  *  *  #
4 *  *  *  *

In the above pattern, the row is denoted by i and the column is denoted by j. 
We see that the first row prints only a star. The second-row prints two stars, and so on. 
The colored blocks print the spaces.

Let's create the logic for the pattern, give above. In the following code snippet, 
we are starting row and column value from 0. We can also start it from 1, it's your choice.
