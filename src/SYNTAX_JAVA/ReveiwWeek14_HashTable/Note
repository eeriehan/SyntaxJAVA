HashTable:
    HashTable is previous version of HashMap. Hashtable is thread safe. It uses synchronization to achieve
    thread safety and because of this it is slow as compared to hashMap.

    -Why QA should not use Hashtable.******
        As a Tester its very rare that we will be writing multithreaded code and if you don't write multithreaded
        code but still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benefit.

    -Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
        Hashtable is thread-safe while hashMap is Not.

Maps:
    How can we iterate through a map

+Important concepts for your coding tests:
                                            -if else conditions
                                            -loops
                                            -arrays
                                            -String class methods
                                            -ArrayList
                                            -Maps

+Important concepts for verbal interviews:
                                     -OOPs
                                     -Frameworks:
                                             1)  how Classes work for example, how to create a class,
                                                 how to declare instance variables, how to use them inside methods
                                             2)  Go through all the concepts of methods
                                             3)  Types of variables like instance static(you will be using heavily)
                                             4)  Inheritance
                                             5)  ArrayList and Maps
                                     -FileHandling in java:
                                             Reading, writing and manipulating files.

--------------------------- File Handling -------------------------------------------------

+ Why we should learn about file handling?:

  1) We don't store sensitive data inside the code. It might get exposed when we push the code to GitHub/public.

  2) Hardcoding the data or credentials in code is a very bad practice. Because for any reason, If you have
     to change the credentials/data you will have to change it everywhere which will take a lot of time.

  3) When we have to perform data driven testing we use a lot of data to perform this type of testing
     it is not feasible to put all of that data in code.

+Steps to Read from any file in java:

  1)  First, we need the location(path)

  2)  Use a class to navigate to that location (for example FileInputStream)

  3)  We need a class that can help us read/write data to that special type of file. For example
      for .properties file we use Properties and for excel we use XSSFWorkbook
