FileHandling:
    Reading writing data to files with the help of Java is called file handling.

Steps to read data from any files on any computer:
    1)  location of file on our computer./ need to know the location(path) of the file.
    2)  we need to go to that location./ navigate to that location where file is stored.
    3)  we need a software that can read and write data to that file for example we need Microsoft Excel
        if we want to work with xlsx files.

FileHandling in java:

    Reading, writing and manipulating files using java code is called fileHandling.
Why should we learn FileHandling:
    1)  When we perform data driven testing we need to store data in files.
    2)  Storing critical data like userNames and passwords inside the code is bad, because when we push the code to
        github those info will also be pushed with it, to avoid this we use properties files.
    3)  Sometimes data can be huge in GBs, and it is very bad practice to push GBS to GitHub.
