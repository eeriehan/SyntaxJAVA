Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that control the access of methods fields or the class itself.
    There are four access levels.

Private:
    If something has the access level of private that thing can only be accessed within the same class.
    This access level is the most restricted one. For fields/properties/state of a class, we should
    always try to have private access level so that the data of a class is secured.

Default:
    Default is not a keyword. it's an access level. if we don't use any keyword with fields or methods
    java applies the default access level automatically. Once applied we can access those entities
    within the same class as well as in any class within teh same package.

Protected:
    When applied entities can be accessed outside the package as well but only on the class that
    have parent-child relationship.

Public:
     When the public access modifier is applied to an entity that entity can be accessed anywhere
     inside that project. usually the classes itself and methods are declared as public.

Note:
    If we are inside the same class we can call a method inside another by just writing its name.
    But we need to take care that these methods are both either static or non-static.
