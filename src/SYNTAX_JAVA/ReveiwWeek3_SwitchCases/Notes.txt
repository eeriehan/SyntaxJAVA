Type casting:

	Type casting is converting the type of data from one data type to another on.
	We have two types of type casting. 
	
		1). Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
		2). Implicit/Widening/Automatic
		
		*	When we go from a bigger data type to a smaller one it is called Explicit/Narrowing/Manual
			and
			when we go from a smaller data type to a larger data type we call it Implicit/Widening/Automatic.
	
		**	byte(8) -> short(16) -> char(16) -> int(32) -> long(64) -> float(32) -> double(64)
			
		***	|---------->				 Widening And Narrowing 				<------------|
		
	Why we need type casting?
		
		When we are working in teams we might need to convert data from different data types.
		When we are working with math sometimes we need to get rid of decimal part 
		as we are only interested in the non-decimal part of digit.
	
	What is the Syntax?
	
		Explicit/narrowing/Manual
		
			int box = 1000;							short biggerBox1 = 129;
			byte box2 = (byte) box;					byte smallerBox2 = (byte) biggerBox1;
														System.out.println(smallerBox);
			
		Implicit/widening/Automatic
		
			short smallerBox3=45;
        	long largerBox3 = smallerBox3;
       			System.out.println(largerBox3);

If statements:
     	
     	if else conditions allow us to write programs that can take decision
     	based on some condition and provided data.
   		
   		if 				condition
   		if else   		condition
   		if else if		condition
   		nested if else	condition
			
	Why we should learn about if else condition?
	
		When we are solving real life problems, like testing a app our programs needs to make a lot of decisions.
	
	What is the SYNTAX_JAVA of if else conditions?
		
		if 		condition
		
			boolean rich = true;
				if(rich)
				{
				System.out.println("Lets buy a house");
				}
