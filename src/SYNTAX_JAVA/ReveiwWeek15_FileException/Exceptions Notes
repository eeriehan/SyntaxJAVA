- Exceptions:
    It's an unwanted behaviour that occurs tha runtime and disturbs the normal flow of a program.

- Why we should learn about exception?:
    1.  When we are building applications for other users like google Chrome, Discord, Zoom etc. We can
    use 'Exception handling' to improve the user experience when we handle exception applications no
    longer terminate abruptly.
    2.  To convert complex system generated error messages to something that everyone can understand.
 -> 3.  We can use exception to figure out the exact line of code and can also get an explanation about that error.

- What is the syntax:
    We can handle exceptions using 'try'-'catch' block.
    We can also utilize 'finally' block
    We use some new keywords like 'throw' and 'throws'.

    try - catch block:
        try {
        // the code that might cause some problems.
        }
        catch( the name of the class whose exception we are expecting ) {
        // backup code or the code that we want to execute in case the code in try block fails.
        }
        finally {
        // the code that we want to execute no matter what happens in try or catch block
        // for example closing the critical system resources like files releasing database connection etc.
        }

    Throw keyword:
        We use Throw keyword to through the exceptions.

    Throws keyword:
        When we want to avoid writing a try catch block we can use throws keyword with method header to throw
        this responsibility to the caller of the method.
        It's bad, and We should avoid it if we know how to handle an exceptions.
