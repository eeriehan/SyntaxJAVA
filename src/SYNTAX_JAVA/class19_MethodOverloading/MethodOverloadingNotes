MethodOverloading:
    Method overloading allows us to create multiple methods in a class with same name.
Why we should create multiple methods with same name?
    It gives the end user flexibility.
    The end user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different
    results.
Hoe do we overload a method?
    1)  by passing different number of parameters.
    2)  by changing the data-type.
    3) By changing the sequence of parameters
