-	what is an Object?
		
		Everything around us is an object for example keyboard, mouse, glass, etc.
		 Objects can be defined based on how they look and how they behave. 
		  Objects in computer programming are also very similar. 
		   They have state (Which helps us define how that object looks like) and behaviors (What that object does)

-	what is Class?

		-	Class is blue-print/design/template from which we create the objects.
		-	is a user defined.
		-	is template for creating different objects which defines its features and behaviors.
		-	in order to create an object you need a class
		-	a class contains variables, methods, constructors etc...
		-	you can have multiple objects for the same class
		     
	ex).	    class Class_name {
		     	field or variable ;
		     	method like main()

-	Object Oriented Programming:	Its just a way of writing programs.

-	Why we should learn OOP(Object Oriented Programming)?
		1).	it simplify the development of large programs.
		2).	it will also help us maintain and modify the existing code!
		3). it helps write more secure code.
		4).	it helps us avoid duplicate code.

-	What is the SYNTAX?

-	What is the Method in Java
	-	A java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation
	-	Method describes behavior of an object
	-	Method contains a block of code
	-	You can say a method is a subprogram that acts on data and often returns a value.
