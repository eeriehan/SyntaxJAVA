Logical Operators:
	
-	Help us test more than one conditions. In java we have 	:
		
							&& 		as the 		'And'
							||		as the 		'Or'
							!		as the		'Not'

-	Why we should learn Logical Operators?
		-Logical operators help us reduce the number of if-conditions that we write in certain cases.
	
-	What is the Syntax?
	ex1)	if (condition1 && condition2) {
				system.out.println("hello");
			}
		
		can be written as
		
	ex2)	if (condition1) {
				if (condition2) {
				system.out.println("hello");
				}
			}
