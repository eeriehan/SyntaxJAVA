Loops:
	Loops in java help us execute a piece of code again and and again.
	There are mainly 4 types of loops	-	for loop
											while loop
											do while loop
											enhanced for loop
	
Why we should learn about loop?:
	Because loops help use write cleaner and scalable code. for example if you have
	to test password field on a web-page you can create different variation of data
	in an Excel sheet than you pick all the values one by one and test the field.
	
Syntax for loops:
	for loop
		for (starting point; ending point; step size) {
				""Code that we want repeat""
		}
	-------------------------
ex)

public class ForLoopDemo1 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
	for (System.out.println("1"); true; System.out.println("3")) {
		
		System.out.println("2");
		
		}
	}
}
output:	3
		2
		3 ...
		
		
	all the loops are interchangeable but sometimes using the on type of loop can make
your code cleaner and easier to understand.
