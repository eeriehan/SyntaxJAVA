Method Overriding:
    Allows us to have same name methods in parent and child classes.
Why we should Override a method:
    Lets say we are inheritaning from a Parent class that has 10 methods. we like 8 of them. we want to reuse those
    methods, but we don't like 2 of them we want to provide implementation in a different way. We can use method overriding.
    to override those methods.
what is the syntax to override a method:
    we simply redefine the method in the child class.
