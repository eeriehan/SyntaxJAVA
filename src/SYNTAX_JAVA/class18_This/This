"this" keyword:
    "this" is keyword like "class", "void". it is used in many places. For example
    if we have same name instance and a local variable we can use "this" to explicitly
    refer to instance variable. We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another
    constructor.
Why should we learn about "this" keyword:
    1). It allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
    2). If we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor
        inside another constructor by writing "this()".

Inheritance:
    Inheritance is a mechanism in Java through which we can use the fields/methods of one
    class inside another class.
    There are 4 types of inheritance.
    1). Single inheritance:
            In single inheritance we have only one parent and one child class.
            Employee -> Person
    2). Multi-level Inheritance:
            In Multilevel Inheritance we have inheritance in multiple levels like we have
            grandfather -> father -> son -> grandson
    3). Hierarchical Inheritance:
            One parent class and multiple direct child classes.
    4). Multiple Inheritance:
            One child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. it is not
            supported in Java.
Why should we learn inheritance?:
    It allows to reduce the duplicate code.
What is the syntax?:
    We can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is inheritance:
    Its a mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.
Why we should learn inheritance:
    it helps us avoid code duplication
    it helps us save space.
    it helps us improve the execution speed.
What is the syntax?
    we use the extends keyworkd and the name of the class from which we want to inherit the fields
    and methods while declaring the class.
Type of inheritance:
    There can be 4 types of inheritance but java only supports 3 of them with classes.
    1.  single
    2.  multilevel
    3.  hierarchical
    4.  Multiple(Not supported by classes in JAVA)
Single inheritance:
    When we have only one parent and one child classes in inheritance it is called single inheritance.
    Not widely used.
MultiLevel Inheritance:
    One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For Ex) A<B<C<D.
Hierarchical inheritance:
    When we have one parent class and multiple child classes it's called Hierarchical inheritance.
Multiple Inheritance:
    One child and multiple parent classes. it is not supported by classes in Java. it creates the Diamond.

Super keyword:
    We use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class. When we have same name
    instance variable in child class and parent class.
    We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class
