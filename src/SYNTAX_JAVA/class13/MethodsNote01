Methods

A Java method is collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation.
For example, When you call the System.out.println() method, the system executes several
statements in order to display a message on the console.

    To Learn:
    -How to create your methods with or without return values
    -Invoke a method with or without parameters, and
    -Apply method abstraction in the program design.

Method definition consists of a method header and a method body. The same is shown below:

    modifier returnType nameofMethod (Parameter List) {
    // method body
    }

    ** void <- When not returning anything.
