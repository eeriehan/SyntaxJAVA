Collections Framework:
    Collection framework is collection of multiple classes and interfaces which help us process the data
    efficiently and easily.
why we should learn about it.
    1) Its very flexible.
    2) Provide ready-made methods that we can just use.
what is the Syntax?
    Its similar how we create the object of any class, but we use <> to specify the name of the class whose objects
    we are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections framework:
    1) Collection framework does not work with primitive datatypes(solution is use wrapper classes).

Note: frequently asked in interviews!!!!!!!

Wrapper classes:
    wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types.
Boxing:
    converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling methods.
    int num=10;
            // boxing or manual conversion from primitive to wrapper type
          //  Integer wrappedNum=Integer.valueOf(num);
Auto Boxing:
    converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
     Integer wrappedNum=10;
Unboxing:
    Converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primtive type by explicitly calling a method.
      //unboxing converting a wrapper type to a corresponding primitive type
          //  int num2=wrappedNum.intValue();
Auto Unboxing:
    converting a wrapper to corresponding primitive automatically by just assigning the value.
    Integer wrappedNum=new Integer(10);
    int num2=wrappedNum;
